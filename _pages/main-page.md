  <h2>Get to know me!</h2>
  <p>
    I am a current Master's student in the MGIS program at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities (est. graduation Spring 2027), and have previously earned a B.S. from the Environmental Geosciences program at the UMN's College of Science and Engineering. Thus, I am interested in how GIS principles and technology can be leveraged to solve environmental problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my academic tenure I have developed robust programming skills, particularly in Python. Further, I have ample work experience with the ESRI suite of tools, with specific strengths in utilizing ArcGIS Pro and ArcPy. I am a dependable worker, both individually and in a team, and I ensure that my duties are done efficiently at the highest quality possible. Previous career endeavors have supplied me with remote sensing abilties and expertise in automation of geospatial workflows. Outside of my technical skills, I am a great communicator and a voracious worker; I strive to open any door I can!
  </p>
  <p>
    I am drawn to the public sector and seek to give back to my community. My primary goal in my future career is to be able to say that I have benefitted the world in some way, no matter the magnitude of impact.
